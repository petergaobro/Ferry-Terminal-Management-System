Task is designed to take a **small amount of time**, and requires minimal knowledge of React. There are no hidden tricks or gotchas, any elegant submission which meets the requirements **will result in an interview**.

You are welcome to exceed the requirements of the test, and re-write or remove any existing code if you believe it is the right thing to do.

Be sure to read and follow the instructions for submitting your completed test.

# Ferry Terminal!

Peter has bought a small ferry terminal and two ferries are available at any one time.

Ferry Types:

#### Small Ferry\*\*

A Small Ferry can hold 8 small vehicles

#### Large Ferry\*

A Large Ferry can hold 6 Large vehicles

#### Vehicle types

Each car type costs a different amount to board a ferry.

| Type     | Size    | Cost     |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| Car      | Small   |    $5.00 |
| Van      | Small   |    $7.50 |
| Truck	   | Large   |   $10.00 |
| Bus      | Large   |   $15.00 |

The Ferry worker earns 10% of the total ticket cost per day.

## The Test

The goal for this test is to build out the logic to assign these vehicles to the appropriate ferry and to handle when the ferry is full. In addition, you need to calculate **and display** the total amount of revenue for the terminal and the worker.

For each vehicle that boards the ferry calculate how much:

- The terminal earns
- The worker earns

The requirements are deliberately left vague to give you the opportunity to show what you can do.

### React

You are required to submit a solution using **React** using the **Vite** development, other submissions in e.g. VueJS will **not be considered**. We will take your experience (as per your CV/resume) into account when assessing your submission.

You may use well-maintained, publicly available third-party libraries/packages if you believe they will assist in your submission, other than the explicit restrictions stated elsewhere in this document.

To start the project, you will need a recent version of node.js.

From there, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

And navigate to the link displayed in the console (probably http://localhost:5173/)
